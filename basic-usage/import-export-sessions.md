# Import and Export Sessions with FiddlerCore

This article explains how to import and export sessions with FiddlerCore.

## Import Sessions

You can import sessions with FiddlerCore by using the following code:
```c#
    Session[] loaded = Utilities.ReadSessionArchive(sazFilename, false, "", (file, part) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Enter the password for { part } (or just hit Enter to cancel):");
        string sResult = Console.ReadLine();
        Console.WriteLine();
        
        return sResult;
    });
```

## Export Sessions

You can export sessions with FiddlerCore by using the following code:
```c#
    bool success = Utilities.WriteSessionArchive(filename, sessions.ToArray(), password, false);
```

>tip With FiddlerCore version 6.0.0 and above, the SAZ archive will contain additional information about various metrics, such as timings and sizes, through the `SessionMetrics` class.

## Custom SAZ Provider

There are cases when you may want to use custom provider to save FiddlerCore sessions. You do this by setting the following property:
```c#
    FiddlerApplication.oSAZProvider = new CustomSazProvider();
```
