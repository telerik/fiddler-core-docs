# Welcome to FiddlerCore

Thank you for choosing Progress® Telerik® FiddlerCore!

## What Is FiddlerCore and Why Do I Need It?

FiddlerCore is a .NET class library you can integrate into your .NET applications. It's available in .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.0, and .NET Framework 4.5 flavors, which allows using it on Windows, Linux, Mac, and any other platform implementing .NET Standard.

FiddlerCore allows you to capture and modify HTTP and HTTPS traffic just like [Fiddler Everywhere](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-everywhere), without any of the Fiddler user interface.

## Features at a Glance

- HTTP and HTTPS traffic capture and modification.
- Powerful object model for content filtering and modification.
- Store and reload web traffic.
- Support for virtually any client application.
- Support for most devices via mobile proxy settings.
